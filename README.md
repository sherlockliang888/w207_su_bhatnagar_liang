The job market can be a tough place for both job seekers and companies, especially with the overwhelming number of job postings floating around on different platforms. However, there's a new issue making things even trickier – fake job postings. Just picture this: you're scrolling through job listings, trying to find the perfect opportunity, only to discover that some of them are nothing but smoke and mirrors. These fake job postings are created by companies that aren't actually looking to hire anyone. It's a real problem for the entire job market.

Fake job postings not only impact job seekers by creating a misleading impression of an inflated job market but also have broader consequences. The deception can lead to frustration and mistrust among job seekers, damaging their perception of the hiring process. Additionally, the reputation of job search platforms and the companies using them is at stake. If platforms are perceived as hosting numerous fake listings, users may lose trust, impacting the credibility of these platforms. Therefore, the successful identification of these fake job postings can be extremely helpful to improve the overall integrity of the job market and the entities involved.

In this notebook, we took a closer look at how these deceptive job ads were affecting everyone and explored some potential solutions. Luckily, with the machine learning algorithms, we were able to identify fake job descriptions based on textual information. We used a dataset from Kaggle containing approximately 18,000 job descriptions to create classification models which can help predict if job descriptions are fraudulent.
